            A daily calorie deficit can restrict what you can eat. You can't fit
            the calories from your favourite foods into your day. A weekly
            deficit gives you room for the things you enjoy.

            Ever tried to socialise whilst on a diet? It’s hard to fit in the
            calories from snacks, drinks, takeaways and meals out into your
            daily calories. You need to spread them over a week instead.

            When you go over your daily calorie target, you give up, you think
            what’s the point. Not with a weekly calorie deficit, this means
            there is always the next day to make adjustments. It’s not over
            until the...you get it.

            Binge eating, by restricting certain foods, you increase the chance
            of failure, whilst learning how to incorporate them into your week,
            leads to sustained habits and weight-loss.
